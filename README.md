GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional 
set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the 
descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well
as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available 
n Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.
